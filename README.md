## Description

In this application I created a tool to facilitate the production of a high quality ``README.md`` file that can be added any project.<br /> <br />The finished application was used used to create the basis of this very README file.

## Installation

To get started:

  * npm must be initiated and the inquirer package must be installed for application usage.


## Usage

When using this command-line application, the user will need to open an integrated terminal within the desired destination folder. After the necessary installations have been made, invoke the application by typing ``node index.js``.<br /> <br />From there the user will be able to input all desired information into the corresponding fields and a well formatted ``README.md`` file will be generated at the root of the folder in which the terminal is opened in.<br /> <br />The application accomplishes this by integrating the inquirer package and a series of dynamic functions.
